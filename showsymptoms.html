	<h2> Here is what to do: </h2>
	<p>Contact your healthcare provider immediately before going to the emergency room, because incase the symptoms arent related to coronavirus, you might catch it by just going to the emergency room. Keep track of your symptoms.</p>
	<p>How to prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick:
	<li>Stay home- If you are adviced to stay home, do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.</li>    
	<li> Take care of your self- Get rest and stay hydrated. Take vitamins pills expecially vitamin C to increase immune power. </li>
	<li>Use protective equipments- If you have to go out, make
	sure to wear masks, I cannot stress this more, To keep others from spreading Covid, please wear mask when you go out and make contact with other people.</li></p>
